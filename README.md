# FireHawkCRM Tributes - Enhancement Suite

A enhancement suite for the FireHawkCRM Tributes WordPress plugin that initially combines performance optimisations, custom styling, and loading animations into one unified solution. Originally for internal use by Weave Digital Studio / Human Kind.

This enhancement suite is part of a small family of complimentary plugins we've developed to extend FireHawkCRM Tributes functionality for our use building funeral websites in WordPress.
For a complete tribute management solution and CRM, consider trying FireHawkCRM and our other add-ons:

- [FCRM SEOPress Integration](https://github.com/weavedigitalstudio/fcrm-seopress):
  If you use SEOPress on your WordPress site, this replaces the current bundled Yoast SEO integration of the FireHawkCRM Tributes plugin with added support for SEOPress and SEOPress Pro. Meta titles and tags are then controlled by SEOPress.
- [FCRM Plausible Analytics](https://github.com/weavedigitalstudio/fcrm-plausible-analytics):
  Integration for FireHawkCRM Tributes plugin which adds Plausible Analytics tracking code to the individual funerals/tribute pages. Plausible is a privacy-focused analytics to track tribute engagement while respecting visitor privacy.
